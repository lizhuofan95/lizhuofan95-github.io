My name is **Zhuofan Li (李卓凡)**, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at Virginia Tech. I received my PhD in Sociology from the University of Arizona in Summer 2024. 

My current research helps people understand digital society and its relationship with capitalism, knowledge, and power through an interesting paradox called corporate open science. My methodological work helps translate network, language, visual, and geospatial data into theoretical insights. 

On pleasantly unproductive days, I enjoy reading detective stories, skiing, and stargazing on GitHub.
