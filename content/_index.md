My name is **Zhuofan Li (李卓凡)**. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Virginia Tech. I received my PhD in Sociology from the University of Arizona. 

My current research aims to help us better understand digital capitalism and its relationship with knowledge and power through an interesting paradox called corporate open science. My methodological work helps translate network, language, visual, and geospatial data into theoretical insights. At Virginia Tech, I teach in digital sociology. 

I was born and raised in Tangshan, a coal mining, industrial city in Northern China built from ruin after one of the deadliest earthquakes in recorded history, and have been on the move ever since. On pleasantly unproductive days, I enjoy reading, skiing, and stargazing on GitHub.
